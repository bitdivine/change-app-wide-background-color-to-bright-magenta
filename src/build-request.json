      "text": "Update the global theme color tokens so the entire app background uses a bright magenta color instead of the current bright cyan, in both light and dark modes. Apply the change via the CSS variables used by Tailwind (`--background` and any directly related surface tokens such as `--card`, `--popover`, `--border`, `--input`, and `--ring`) in `frontend/src/index.css`, ensuring foreground/text contrast remains readable.",
