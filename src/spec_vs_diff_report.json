      "reason": "REQ-1 specifically calls out `--background` and directly related surface tokens (e.g., `--card`, `--popover`, `--border`, `--input`, `--ring`) to achieve the background change; updating chart tokens and the wider palette goes beyond what was explicitly asked (though may be consistent with a full theme shift).",
